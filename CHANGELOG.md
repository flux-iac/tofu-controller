# v0.16.0-rc.4

**Release date:** 2024-03-14

This is the first release of the project after rebooting under its new name and organization: Tofu Controller, now part of the Flux-IaC organization. Fully driven by our community, Tofu Controller and Flux-IaC aim to help innovate the development of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) controllers for Flux.

Thank you so much to our vibrant community, which propelled us to reach 1,000 stars on GitHub recently.

With the renaming of the controller, our community has identified several breaking changes, although some may have been missed. The transition from Weave TF-Controller to Flux-IaC Tofu-Controller could be challenging. We advise:

  * Backing up your Terraform states (tfstates)
  * Setting `spec.destroyResourcesOnDeletion=false` to avoid unintentional resource deletion
  * Pausing all Terraform CRs

before doing the upgrade.

**BREAKING CHANGES**

  * The renaming of the controller.
  * Reorganization of CRDs in the Helm Chart, which may lead to their uninstallation and reinstallation.

New Features and Bug Fixing:

  * Pass missing build arg TARGETARCH to docker-build.
  * Implement BLOB encryption within the tf-runner.
  * Add `tfvars` feature and API.
  * Generate checksum for cache blobs.
  * Implement remediation retry.
  * Add unique hash to cloned source to avoid conflict.
  * Speed up compiling of binaries.
  * Added config for building tf-runner image and using it in helloworld example.
  * Bump version in manifest used in user guide to reflect latest RC.
  * Document a fix to "terraform objects stuck on deletion" issue.
  * Fix docker build breaking due to LIBCRYPTO_VERSION.
  * Fix issues surfaced around the polling server.
  * Add documentation about IPv6 support.
  * Update branch planner default configuration.

# v0.16.0-rc.3

**Release date:** 2023-09-19

We've been implementing the new feature called the Branch Planner during v0.15.x as a separate component.
And it has been included in the installation of TF-Controller since v0.16.0-rc.2.
This version also includes many improvement for the Branch Planner.
Branch Planner allows us to interact with Pull Requests to plan and review the planning process with a separate branch,
while the GitOps automation is still working on the main branch. This feature is currently Technology Preview.

**BREAKING CHANGES**

This version also introduced the lockdown mode by default.
Lockdown is the mode that enhances security for your Terraform Controller setup
by preventing the Terraform objects from referencing cross-namespace Secrets and ConfigMaps.
To relax this restriction, you can enable `--allow-cross-namespace-refs` flag at the controller level.
This setting can also be done via a Helm Chart value too.

**Release date:** 2022-11-06

New Features and Bug Fixing:
  * Update Source controller to v0.31.0 / Flux v0.36.0 (@chanwit)
  * Improve `tfctl` commands (@chanwit)

# v0.13.0

**Release date:** 2022-10-27

A notable feature in this version is the first-class YAML support for Terraform.
A Terraform object in v0.13.0+ allows you to better configure your Terraform resources via YAMLs, 
without introducing any extra CRDs to your cluster. 

Together with a new generator, Tofu-Jet, we'll now be able to ship pre-generated 
primitive Terraform modules for all major cloud providers. We shipped the alpha version of AWS package in this release.

A primitive Terraform module is a module that only contains a single primitive resource,
like `aws_iam_role`, or `aws_iam_policy`. With this concept, we would be able to use Terraform
without writing Terraform codes, and make it more GitOps-friendly at the same time.
