With the power of Flux together with Terraform, TF-controller allows you to GitOps-ify infrastructure, and application resources, in the Kubernetes and Terraform universe, at your own pace. \"At your own pace\" means you don't need to GitOps-ify everything at once. TF-controller offers many GitOps models: 1. GitOps Automation Model: GitOps your Terraform resources from the provision steps to the enforcement steps, like a whole EKS cluster. 2. Hybrid GitOps Automation Model: GitOps parts of your existing infrastructure resources. For example, you have an existing EKS cluster. You can choose to GitOps only its nodegroup, or its security group. 3. State Enforcement Model: You have a TFSTATE file, and you'd like to use GitOps enforce it, without changing anything else. 4. Drift Detection Model: You have a TFSTATE file, and you'd like to use GitOps just for drift detection, so you can decide to do things later when a drift occurs. To get started, follow the getting started guide. Features Multi-Tenancy : TF-controller supports multi-tenancy by running Terraform plan and apply inside Runner Pods. When specifying .metadata.namespace and .spec.serviceAccountName , the Runner Pod uses the specified ServiceAccount and runs inside the specified Namespace. These settings enable the soft multi-tenancy model, which can be used within the Flux multi-tenancy setup. This feature is available since v0.9.0. GitOps Automation for Terraform : With setting .spec.approvePlan=auto , it allows a Terraform object to be reconciled and act as the representation of your Terraform resources. The TF-controller uses the spec of the Terraform object to perform plan , apply its associated Terraform resources. It then stores the TFSTATE of the applied resources as a Secret inside the Kubernetes cluster. After .spec.interval passes, the controller performs drift detection to check if there is a drift occurred between your live system, and your Terraform resources. If a drift occurs, the plan to fix that drift will be generated and applied automatically. This feature is available since v0.3.0. Drift detection : This feature is a part of the GitOps automation feature. The controller detects and fixes drift for your infrastructures, based on the Terraform resources and their TFSTATE . This feature is available since v0.5.0. Drift detection is enabled by default. You can use the field .spec.disableDriftDetection to disable this behaviour. This feature is available since v0.7.0. The Drift detection only mode, without plan or apply steps, allows you to perform read-only drift detection. This feature is available since v0.8.0. Plan and Manual Approve : This feature allows you to separate the plan , out of the apply step, just like the Terraform workflow you are familiar with. A good thing about this is that it is done in a GitOps way. When a plan is generated, the controller shows you a message like 'set approvePlan: \"plan-main-123\" to apply this plan.' . You make change to the field .spec.approvePlan , commit and push to tell the TF-controller to apply the plan for you. With this GitOps workflow, you can optionally create and push this change to a new branch for your team member to review and approve too. This feature is available since v0.6.0.

You can use eksctl to associate an OIDC provider with your EKS cluster, for example: eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --cluster CLUSTER_NAME --approve Then follow the instructions here to add a trust policy to the IAM role which grants the necessary permissions for Terraform. Please note that if you have installed the controller following the README, then the namespace:serviceaccountname will be flux-system:tf-controller . You'll obtain a Role ARN to use in the next step. Finally, annotate the ServiceAccount with the obtained Role ARN in your cluster: kubectl annotate -n flux-system serviceaccount tf-controller eks.amazon.com/role-arn=ROLE_ARN Setting Terraform Variables This is a breaking change of the v1alpha1 API. Users who are upgrading from TF-controller <= 0.7.0 require updating varsFrom , from a single object: varsFrom: kind: ConfigMap name: cluster-config to be an array of object, like this: varsFrom: - kind: ConfigMap name: cluster-config You can pass variables to Terraform using the vars and varsFrom fields. Inline variables can be set using vars . The varsFrom field accepts a list of ConfigMaps / Secrets. You may use the varsKeys property of varsFrom to select specific keys from the input or omit this field to select all keys from the input source. Note that in the case of the same variable key being passed multiple times, the controller will use the lattermost instance of the key passed to varsFrom . apiVersion: infra.contrib.fluxcd.io/v1alpha1 kind: Terraform metadata: name: helloworld namespace: flux-system spec: approvePlan: \"auto\" interval: 1m path: ./ sourceRef: kind: GitRepository name: helloworld namespace: flux-system vars: - name: region value: us-east-1 - name: env value: dev - name: instanceType value: t3-small varsFrom: - kind: ConfigMap name: cluster-config varsKeys: - nodeCount - instanceType - kind: Secret name: cluster-creds The vars field supports HCL string, number, bool, object and list types.

The statefile is stored in a secret named: tfstate-default-${secretSuffix} . The default suffix will be the name of the Terraform resource, however you may override this setting using .spec.backendConfig.secretSuffix . You can disable the backend Backup the statefile For the following terraform resources: $ kubectl get terraform NAME READY STATUS AGE my-stack Unknown Initializing 28s We can export the state like this: kubectl get secret tfstate-default-my-stack -ojsonpath='{.data.tfstate}' | base64 -d | gzip -d > terraform.tfstate Restore the statefile To restore the statefile or import an existing statefile we can use the following operation: gzip terraform.tfstate NAME=my-stack kubectl create secret \\ generic tfstate-default-${NAME} \\ --from-file=tfstate=terraform.tfstate.gz \\ --dry-run=client -o=yaml \\ | yq e '.metadata.annotations[\"encoding\"]=\"gzip\"' - > tfstate-default-${NAME}.yaml kubectl apply -f tfstate-default-${NAME}.yaml Health Checks For some resources, it may be useful to perform health checks on them to verify that they are ready to accept connection before the terraform goes into Ready state: # main.tf output \"rdsAddress\" { value = \"mydb.xyz.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com\" } output \"rdsPort\" { value = \"3306\" } output \"myappURL\" { value = \"https://example.com/\" } apiVersion: infra.contrib.fluxcd.io/v1alpha1 kind: Terraform metadata: name: helloworld namespace: flux-system spec: approvePlan: \"auto\" interval: 1m path: ./ sourceRef: kind: GitRepository name: helloworld namespace: flux-system healthChecks: - name: rds type: tcp address: \"{{.rdsAddress}}:{{.rdsPort}}\" # uses standard Go package template format to parse outputs to url timeout: 10s # optional, defaults to 20s - name: myapp type: http url: \"{{.myappURL}}\" timeout: 5s - name: url_not_from_output type: http url: \"https://example.org\" Destroy resources on deletion The resources created by terraform are not defaulted to destroyed after the object is deleted from the cluster.

For example, we might retrieve a key from a Secret manager, and it's an AGE key, which must be ending with \".agekey\" in the secret. In this case, we need to rename the output. TF-controller supports mapping output name using the \"old_name:new_name\" format. In the following example, we write age_key output as age.agekey entry in the helloworld-output Secret's data. apiVersion: infra.contrib.fluxcd.io/v1alpha1 kind: Terraform metadata: name: helloworld namespace: flux-system spec: approvePlan: \"auto\" interval: 1m path: ./ sourceRef: kind: GitRepository name: helloworld namespace: flux-system writeOutputsToSecret: name: helloworld-output outputs: - age_key:age.agekey Customize runner pod Customize runner pod metadata In some situations, it is needed to add custom labels and annotations to the runner pod used to reconcile Terraform.
