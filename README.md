# Tofu Controller: An IAC Controller for Flux

[![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/7761/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/7761)

Tofu Controller (previously known as Weave TF-Controller) is a controller for [Flux](https://fluxcd.io) to reconcile OpenTofu and Terraform resources
in the GitOps way.
With the power of Flux together with OpenTofu and Terraform, Tofu Controller allows you to GitOps-ify infrastructure,
and application resources, in the Kubernetes and IAC universe, at your own pace.

"At your own pace" means you don't need to GitOps-ify everything at once.

Tofu Controller offers many GitOps models:
  1. **GitOps Automation Model:** GitOps your OpenTofu and Terraform resources from the provision steps to the enforcement steps, like a whole EKS cluster.
  2. **Hybrid GitOps Automation Model:** GitOps parts of your existing infrastructure resources. For example, you have an existing EKS cluster.
     You can choose to GitOps only its nodegroup, or its security group.
  3. **State Enforcement Model:** You have a TFSTATE file, and you'd like to use GitOps enforce it, without changing anything else.
  4. **Drift Detection Model:** You have a TFSTATE file, and you'd like to use GitOps just for drift detection, so you can decide to do things later when a drift occurs.
