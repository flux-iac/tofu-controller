# tf-controller Security

This document defines security reporting, handling and disclosure information for the tf-controller project and community.

## Security Process

### Report a Vulnerability

We're very thankful for – and if desired happy to credit – security researchers and users who report vulnerabilities to the tf-controller community.

- To make a report please email the private security list at <security@weave.works> with the details.
  We ask that reporters act in good faith by not disclosing the issue to others.
- The Security Team will investigate the issue as soon as possible and where needed, coordinate a release date with relevant parties.
- You will be able to choose if you want public acknowledgement of your effort and how you would like to be credited.
- Please note that we do not run a bug bounty program and therefore no financial compensation should be expected when reporting a vulnerability.

### Security Team

Our Security Team consists of project maintainers and Weaveworks employees.

### Handling

- All reports are thoroughly investigated by the Security Team.
- Any vulnerability information shared with the Security Team will not be shared with others unless it is necessary to fix the issue.
  Information is shared only on a need to know basis.
- As the security issue moves through the identification and resolution process, the reporter will be notified.
- Additional questions about the vulnerability may also be asked of the reporter.

### Disclosures

Vulnerability disclosures are announced publicly through our [security advisories](https://github.com/weaveworks/tf-controller/security/advisories).
Disclosures will contain an overview, details about the vulnerability, a fix that will typically be an update, and optionally a workaround if one is available.

We will coordinate publishing disclosures and security releases in a way that is realistic and necessary for end users.
We prefer to fully disclose the vulnerability as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available.
Disclosures will always be published in a timely manner after a release is published that fixes the vulnerability.
